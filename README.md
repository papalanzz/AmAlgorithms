</div>




**Algorithm Visualizer & Debugger** is a powerful web-based tool designed to help users better understand and visualize algorithms in action. Whether you‚Äôre a student learning algorithms for the first time or a seasoned developer brushing up on your skills, this tool provides an interactive and engaging way to explore a wide variety of algorithms from Data Structures, Sorting, Trees, Graphs, and Machine Learning.

## Application Goals

1. To provide a platform for users interested in computer science to intuitively and interactively learn data structures, algorithms, and fundamental computer science concepts through browser-based visualizations. 

2. To guide users through learning paths to introduce real world problems and how they can be solved with classic CS algorithms and essential details for each algorithm to gain intuition.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Interactive Visualizations:** Watch algorithms come to life with dynamic, step-by-step visualizations using **React** and **D3**.
- **Debugger Window:** Control the flow of the algorithm with a built-in debugger. Pause, step forward, or step backward to analyze each stage of the process in detail.
- **Wide Range of Algorithms:** Explore various categories including:
  - **Data Structures:** Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, and more.
  - **Sorting Algorithms:** Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc.
  - **Tree Algorithms:** Binary Search Trees, AVL Trees, etc.
  - **Graph Algorithms:** Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Dijkstra's Algorithm, etc.
  - **Machine Learning Algorithms:** k-NN, Decision Trees, and more.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Intuitive and clean UI for easy navigation and understanding.
- **Customizable Parameters:** Adjust algorithm parameters (e.g., speed, input size) to see how they affect performance and outcomes.
